  Notes:
	- With a single search term, the tool searches both name and address.
	- With two search terms, the first term must match the address field, and the second term must match the name field.
	- When there are two search terms, both must match.
	- The --match_case option requires case sensitive matching. It works with all other options.
	- To customize the list of names add a custom section to the config file (see documentation).
	- Name file: ~/.quickBlocks/names/names.tab (1002501)
